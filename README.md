# House Price Prediction Model

This repository contains a Python script for building a house price prediction model using machine learning techniques. The code includes data exploration, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation steps.

## Overview

The main goals of this project are:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Understand the dataset through general insights, analysis of categorical and numerical variables, analysis of the target variable, and correlation analysis.

2. **Feature Engineering:** Create new features, handle outliers, and perform encoding for categorical variables.

3. **Model Building:** Train various regression models on the dataset and evaluate their performance.

## Requirements

To run the code, you need the following libraries:

- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- CatBoost
- LightGBM
- XGBoost
